# Data Presentation

With the extensive prep-work done and the data analysis completed, it is time to present the findings. Comprehensive dashboards, reports, presentations, infographics, and many other forms of data presentation can be created to communicate the findings. The intention is to effectively communicate your findings in such a way where people are empowered with new intuitive insights that can be used to make informed decisions -- whatever the context may be.
